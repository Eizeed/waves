## CLI tool for downloading youtube videos as audio files and writing metadata.

### dependencies
- yt-dlp for downloading from youtube
- fpcalc (chromaprint) for getting audio fingerprint

#### I would like to say that if you can support artists, please do so.
The purpose of this app is to make process of downloading tracks from youtube seamless.  
You can just download them, and you can also fetch metadata using fingerprint and acoustID,  
and rewrite tags of audio file locally.

#### Note
App also depends on https://api.acoustid.org  
I will write proper README.md later
